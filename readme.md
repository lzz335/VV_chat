# Notice  

## Data Source  



The meme dataset associated with Zhang Weiwei used in this project originates from publicly available content on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/question/656505859/answer/55843704436). **This is a third-party resource not affiliated with or endorsed by this project. This project only uses this dataset as a demonstration of the algorithm's effectiveness** If you are a rights holder and believe any content requires removal, please promptly contact us via [insert contact method].  


**The starting point of this project comes from the admiration for Teacher Zhang**

**Important Notice:** Users must independently download the dataset from Zhihu and ensure they have obtained proper authorization for any usage that may exceed fair use protections under applicable copyright laws.  



## Technical Specifications  



- This project utilizes **ChromaDB** as its database system. A functional **C++ compilation environment** is required for operation. Configuration reference: [C++ Environment Guide](https://blog.csdn.net/...)  

- Text embedding processing employs the **bgaaai/bge-large-zh-v1.5** model developed by Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence.  

- Interface implementation uses **Gradio** framework.  



## Usage Instructions  



1. First-time users must install dependencies via the provided `requirements.txt` using Anaconda.  
2. Execute `init.sh` from the project root directory via command prompt.  

**Note:** Users must customize environment variables and file paths within `init.sh` according to their system configuration.  

3. Subsequent executions utilize `run.sh` after successful initialization.
